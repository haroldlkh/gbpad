# Complexity Analysis

# Parsing the Input:
# O(N) where N is the length of s.

# Generating Words:
# There are O(k^m) possible words, where:

# k is the average size of each group.
# m is the number of groups.
# Backtracking runs in O(k^m) and stores O(k^m) words.

# ðŸ”¹ Total Complexity: O(N + k^m)
